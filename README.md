# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection üí≥üîç

## Overview  
This project addresses the critical issue of credit card fraud by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and the **Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE)** to handle the class imbalance inherent in fraud detection datasets. The goal is to enhance fraud detection accuracy and reliability, providing a robust solution for real-world financial applications.

---

## Key Highlights  
- **Dataset**:  
  - Sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), the dataset includes **284,807 transactions** made by European cardholders in September 2013.  
  - Only **492 transactions (0.172%)** are fraudulent, reflecting a significant class imbalance.

- **Techniques**:  
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Addressed outliers and ensured data integrity for accurate modeling.  
  - **SMOTE**: Balanced the dataset by generating synthetic samples for the minority class.  
  - **Sampling Strategies**: Explored both under-sampling and SMOTE-based over-sampling to evaluate model performance.  

- **Models**:  
  - Implemented Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).  
  - **Gradient Boosting** emerged as the best-performing model, with an **AUC of 0.99** and a high recall of **95%**.  

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Focused on **recall**, **F1-score**, and **AUC** for a balanced assessment of model effectiveness in detecting fraud.
